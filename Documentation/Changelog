CHANGELOG

* 2015/05/08:

    - Implemented 'ignore', 'check' and 'follow' for links
      allowing recursive link crawling.

    - Print all http status codes > 400 instead of just 404.

    - Follow redirects.
      May add an option later to turn them off.

    - Check the headers content type when crawling
      to avoid doing get requests when possible.

    - Ignore fragments.

* 2015/05/06:

    - First version.
